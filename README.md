# 👋 Hi, I'm Ayo!

**🎓 Junior at Howard University, studying Computer Engineering**

**🔭 Aspiring Software Engineer and Machine Learning enthusiast**

I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, especially in the areas of data science, machine learning, and impactful community tech. Whether it's building clustering models to explore global well-being or helping develop FPGA-based games from scratch, I’m always looking for ways to learn, collaborate, and create something meaningful.

💡 Currently, I’m growing my skills as a Break Through Tech Fellow, where I’ve been sharpening my technical edge through industry-backed training and mentorship.
